# 🗣️ Hate Speech & Offensive Language Detection

👤 **Solo Project**  
📌 Category: Natural Language Processing | Applied Machine Learning

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
Online platforms face challenges in moderating content that includes **hate speech and offensive language**.  
Manual moderation is time-consuming, making automated detection an important area of study.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To design a machine learning–based NLP system that can **classify text as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral**, supporting content moderation efforts.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
1. Used a labeled dataset containing text samples
2. Applied NLP preprocessing techniques:
   - Text normalization
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
3. Transformed text data into numerical representations using:
   - TF-IDF / Count Vectorization
4. Trained classification models on processed data
5. Evaluated results to understand model behavior and limitations
