# 🔐 Phishing Detection Tool

👤 **Solo Project**  
📌 Category: Applied Machine Learning | Cybersecurity

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, often tricking users into sharing sensitive information through deceptive messages or links.  
The challenge is to **automatically identify phishing content** using patterns present in text data.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To build a machine learning–based system that can **classify textual data as phishing or legitimate**, helping improve awareness and detection of malicious content.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
1. Collected and prepared labeled text data
2. Performed text preprocessing:
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing special characters
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
3. Converted text into numerical features using:
   - TF-IDF / Count Vectorization
4. Trained classification models to distinguish phishing content
5. Evaluated model performance using standard metrics
