👥 **Team Project (2 Members)**  
📌 Category: System Logic / Backend-Oriented Application  
🎯 Domain: Healthcare Operations  
🧠 Language Focus: C++

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
In busy hospitals, waiting areas are often managed manually, leading to **inefficient seat usage, confusion, and poor patient experience**.  
There is a need for a **logic-driven system** that can systematically allocate seats and track availability in real time.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To design and implement a **C++-based system** that manages hospital waiting area seating by:
- Allocating seats logically to patients
- Preventing duplicate or conflicting seat assignments
- Maintaining accurate seat availability status

The project emphasizes **algorithmic thinking and system correctness** rather than UI complexity.

---

## 🧩 Key Functionalities

### 🪑 Seat Allocation Logic
- Assigns available seats to incoming patients
- Ensures no seat is double-allocated
- Handles seat release when patients leave

---

### 🧑‍⚕️ Patient Flow Handling
- Structured handling of patient entries
- Sequential seat assignment
- Designed to support future enhancements like priority seating

---

### 🔄 Dynamic Seat Status Tracking
- Tracks occupied and available seats
- Updates seat state in real time
- Maintains consistency throughout execution

---

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

1. Designed core data structures to represent:
   - Seats
   - Occupancy status
   - Allocation rules
2. Implemented allocation logic using:
   - Conditional checks
   - Iterative processing
   - State management
3. Focused on:
   - Logical correctness
   - Edge case handling
   - Clean, readable C++ code

The system models **real-world operational constraints** through programmatic logic.
