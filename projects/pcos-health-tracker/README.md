# 🩺 PCOS Health Tracker

👥 **Team Project (2 Members)**  
📌 Category: Full-Stack Application | Backend & Product-Oriented System  
🎯 Domain: HealthTech

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS/PCOD) affects many women and often requires **long-term tracking** of menstrual cycles, symptoms, lifestyle habits, and medical reports.  
In most cases, this data is scattered across notebooks, files, or multiple apps, making it difficult to observe patterns or share accurate information during medical consultations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To design and develop a **centralized health tracking system** that allows users to:
- Log menstrual cycle data
- Record daily symptoms
- Store medical reports securely
- View summarized insights through dashboards

The focus of the project was on **backend reliability, structured data management, and a product-like user experience**.
